# Side Events (sideevents.lol)

Never worry about another spreadsheet again!

Sideevents.lol is an app for all the side events associated with a conference.
Event organizers can create their event and link it to whichever conference
they're at. They can then collect sign ups. 

## Passport

This project is a showcase for how to build with and use Gitcoin Passport,
a tool for Sybil resistance and bot protection. Only users with a high enough
Passport score will be able to sign up for your events. This protects your
events from POAP and Airdrop farmers and other bots.
